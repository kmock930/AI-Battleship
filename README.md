# AI BattleShip ⚔️ - Agentic Compare

## Problem Statement
Build a web app that runs the same user created task across multiple agentic AI frameworks & models, then shows side‑by‑side outputs (or plan) and meaningful metrics. Judged on the UX, creativity, and quality of the comparison.

## Prerequisites
1. Prepare necessary keys and secrets according to `.env.sample` in a separate `.env` file at the root directory. (Note: Do **NOT** commit it to Git!)
2. Prepare a `.env.local` at the Next project inside `frontend/` directory, based on `.env.example`, for local frontend debugging.
